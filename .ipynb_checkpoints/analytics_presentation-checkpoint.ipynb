    "Analytics uses data and math to answer business questions, discover relationships, predict unknown outcomes and automate decisions. (https://www.sas.com/en_us/insights/analytics/what-is-analytics.html) \n",
    "\n",
    "You will notice this is extremely vague. Analytics encompasses a lot of different fields and subfields; analytical thinking and skills are used in everything from marine biology to finance. This is good news, because the skills for this are in demand and probably will be for a long time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Disclaimer: if you search for resources on the internet about \"what langauge should I learn?\" or \"How do I get into analytics?\" you will get dozens of different answers! Many different people from many different backgrounds have landed jobs in the field, and you can too. This is just my personal experience."

    "These were created by and maintained by a variety of companies. They are (mostly) not open source. The descriptions here are an over-generalization, but should be enough to get you started. I would probably not recommend you learn any of these as your first programming language. At a general level,  they do fairly similar things though with different syntaxes. If you get fairly in depth though, they become very powerful languages.\n",
